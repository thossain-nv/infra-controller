# Quick Start Guide

This guide walks through deploying NICo end-to-end: from building containers to discovering your first managed host. The core deployment is orchestrated by `setup.sh` in the `helm-prereqs/` directory, which installs all prerequisites and NICo components in the correct order.

Before starting, review the [Prerequisites](prerequisites/hardware.md) for hardware, networking, software, and BMC/OOB requirements.

## Step 1 — Build NICo Containers

Build all NICo container images from source on Ubuntu 24.04. This produces images for Infra Controller Core, DPU BFB artifacts, and the admin CLI.

Refer to the [Building NICo Containers](../manuals/building_nico_containers.md) manual for full build instructions, including x86_64 and aarch64 cross-compilation steps.

Push the built images to your container registry before proceeding.

## Step 2 — Prepare the Kubernetes Cluster

NICo requires a Kubernetes cluster with at least three schedulable nodes (Ready, not tainted NoSchedule/NoExecute) for HA Vault and PostgreSQL. NICo does not provision the cluster itself--operators are expected to provision their own Kubernetes cluster that meets the requirements below using their preferred tooling (kubeadm, Kubespray, managed K8s, etc.).

**Validated baseline:**

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes | v1.30.4 |
| kubelet | v1.26.15 |
| containerd | 1.7.1 |
| CNI (Calico) | v3.28.1 |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS |

The cluster must have:
- `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1` and `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` on every node.
- DNS resolution working (`kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local` resolves on every node).
- Network connectivity to your container registry.

### Site controller node DPU requirements

Site controller nodes must be equipped with fully provisioned DPUs (Bluefield-3s) which are configured **before** the Kubernetes cluster is set up. We do not support configuring site controller nodes without DPUs today. NICo does not provision the site controller nodes' own DPUs — it only manages DPUs on downstream bare-metal hosts after ingestion.

Specifically, you must complete the following before proceeding:

- Flash the DPU firmware to the latest supported version using the BlueField Firmware Bundle. Latest supported firmware versions:

  | DOCA  | HBN   |
  | ----- | ----- |
  | 2.9.3 | 2.4.3 |

- Configure the Bluefield-3 device in DPU mode (operating mode). We do not currently support NIC mode.
- Ensure the DPU ARM OS is booted and reachable via its management interface.
- Verify that the DPU can connect to the outside world (curl -I https://www.google.com)

Refer to the NVIDIA DOCA documentation and the BlueField Firmware Bundle download archive for firmware flashing instructions and supported firmware versions:

[https://developer.nvidia.com/doca-2-9-3-download-archive?deployment_platform=BlueField&deployment_package=BF-FW-Bundle](https://developer.nvidia.com/doca-2-9-3-download-archive?deployment_platform=BlueField&deployment_package=BF-FW-Bundle)

### Required tools (local machine)

The following tools must be installed on the machine that you will use to run `setup.sh`--not on the Kubernetes cluster itself.

| Tool | Min version | Mac | Linux |
|------|-------------|-----|-------|
| `kubectl` | 1.26 | `brew install kubectl` | `snap install kubectl --classic` or [binary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) |
| `helm` | 3.12 | `brew install helm` | `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 \| bash` |
| `helmfile` | 0.162 | `brew install helmfile` | [binary from GitHub releases](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/releases) |
| `helm-diff` plugin | any | `helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff` | same |
| `jq` | 1.6 | `brew install jq` | `apt install jq` / `yum install jq` |
| `ssh-keygen` | any | built-in | built-in |

The `helmfile` tool requires the `helm-diff` plugin. Install it as follows:

```bash
# Helm v4
helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff --verify=false

# Helm v3
helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
```

## Step 3 — Configure the Site

Everything in this step must be done **before** running `setup.sh`. Skipping any item will either cause setup to fail or result in a deployment with incorrect site configuration that is hard to fix after the fact.

### 3a. Set Required Environment Variables

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig                 # cluster kubeconfig
export REGISTRY_PULL_USERNAME=<registry-user>         # registry username
export REGISTRY_PULL_SECRET=<registry-user-pass>      # registry username password
export NICO_IMAGE_REGISTRY=my-registry.example.com/nico  # base registry for all NICo images
export NICO_CORE_IMAGE_TAG=<nico-core-image-tag>      # e.g. v2025.12.30-rc1
export NICO_REST_IMAGE_TAG=<nico-rest-image-tag>      # e.g. v1.0.4
```

`NICO_IMAGE_REGISTRY` is used for both NICo Core (`<registry>/nvmetal-carbide`) and NICo REST (`<registry>/nico-rest-*`). Push all images to this registry before running setup.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `REGISTRY_PULL_SECRET` | **Yes** | Pull secret and API key for your image registry. Used to create the image pull secret for both NICo Core and NICo REST. |
| `NICO_IMAGE_REGISTRY` | **Yes** | Base image registry for all NICo images (e.g. `my-registry.example.com/nico`). Used for NICo Core (`<registry>/nvmetal-carbide`) and NICo REST (`<registry>/nico-rest-*`). |
| `NICO_CORE_IMAGE_TAG` | **Yes** | NICo Core image tag (e.g. `v2025.12.30`). |
| `NICO_REST_IMAGE_TAG` | **Yes** | NICo REST image tag (e.g. `v1.0.4`). |
| `KUBECONFIG` | **Yes** | Path to your cluster kubeconfig. |
| `NICO_SITE_UUID` | No | Stable UUID for this site. If unset, `setup.sh` tries to reuse the UUID from a prior install (site-agent ConfigMap). If that fails, it adopts an existing REST site with the same name, or mints a UUID and seeds the site record itself. |

### 3b. Set your Site Name

Open `helm-prereqs/values.yaml` and change `siteName` from the placeholder to your actual site identifier:

```yaml
siteName: "mysite"   # ← replace "TMP_SITE" with your site name (e.g. "examplesite", "prod-us-east")
```

This value is injected into every postgres pod as the `TMP_SITE` environment variable. It must match the `sitename` in the NICo Core `siteConfig` block below.

To tune PostgreSQL resources for your node capacity (the defaults are conservative for dev), edit the following values:
```yaml
postgresql:
  instances: 3
  volumeSize: "10Gi"
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: "4Gi"
    requests:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "1Gi"
```

### 3c. Configure NICo Core Site Deployment

Open `helm-prereqs/values/nico-core.yaml` and update the following values:

- **API hostname**: The external DNS name for the Infra Controller Core API:

  ```yaml
  nico-api:
    hostname: "nico.mysite.example.com"   # ← must resolve to your cluster's ingress/LB
  ```

- **`siteConfig` TOML block**: The site identity, network topology, and resource pools. These fields are most likely to differ per site:

  | Field | What to set |
  |-------|-------------|
  | `sitename` | Short identifier matching `siteName` in `values.yaml` |
  | `initial_domain_name` | Base DNS domain for the site (e.g. `mysite.example.com`) |
  | `dhcp_servers` | List of DHCP server IPs reachable from bare-metal hosts, or `[]` |
  | `site_fabric_prefixes` | CIDRs that are part of the site fabric (instance-to-instance traffic) |
  | `deny_prefixes` | CIDRs instances must not reach (OOB, control plane, management) |
  | `[pools.lo-ip]` ranges | Loopback IP range allocated to bare-metal hosts |
  | `[pools.vlan-id]` ranges | VLAN ID allocation range |
  | `[pools.vni]` ranges | VXLAN Network Identifier range |
  | `[networks.admin]` | Admin network CIDR, gateway, and MTU |
  | `[networks.<underlay>]` | Underlay data-plane network(s) — one block per L3 segment |

All fields are documented with inline comments in the file.

- **Required fields--do not leave empty:** `[networks.admin]`, `prefix`, and `gateway` must be set to real values. `nico-api` crashes at startup with a parse error if these are empty strings. Similarly, `[pools.lo-ip]`, `[pools.vlan-id]`, and `[pools.vni]` ranges must be non-empty.
 
  These fields are safe to leave as empty arrays: `dhcp_servers`, `site_fabric_prefixes`, `deny_prefixes`. Do not delete any field from the TOML block; missing keys cause a different crash than empty ones.

### 3d. NICo REST source tree

NICo REST lives in this repository under `rest-api/`. The Helm charts, kustomize bases, and helper scripts that `setup.sh` uses for [Phase 7](#setup-script-phases) are resolved in-tree automatically--there is no separate repository to clone and no `NCX_REPO` to set. `preflight.sh` errors out only if `rest-api/` is missing from the checkout.

### 3e. Configure NICo REST Authentication

The default configuration uses the *dev Keycloak instance* that `setup.sh` deploys automatically. No changes are needed if you're running a dev/test environment.

For *production*, or if you are using your own IdP, edit the `helm-prereqs/values/nico-rest.yaml` file as follows:

**Option 1: Use your own Keycloak or OIDC-compatible IdP**

```yaml
nico-rest-api:
  config:
    keycloak:
      enabled: true
      baseURL: "https://keycloak.mysite.example.com"
      externalBaseURL: "https://keycloak.mysite.example.com"
      realm: "your-realm"
      clientID: "nico-api"
```

**Option 2: Disable Keycloak and use a generic OIDC issuer**

```yaml
nico-rest-api:
  config:
    keycloak:
      enabled: false
    issuers:
      - issuer: "https://your-oidc-provider.example.com"
        audience: "nico-api"
```

When `keycloak.enabled: false`, the Keycloak deployment is still created by `setup.sh`, but `nico-rest-api` will not use it for token validation.

#### Optional: Expose NICo REST over TLS with Ingress

By default, `setup.sh` exposes `nico-rest-api` through a NodePort in `helm-prereqs/values/nico-rest.yaml`. To expose it through a fully qualified domain name with TLS, enable the `nico-rest-api` ingress and configure its certificate settings in that file:

```yaml
nico-rest-api:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    className: nginx
    hosts:
      - host: rest-api.mysite.example.com
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      - secretName: rest-api-mysite-example-com-tls
        hosts:
          - rest-api.mysite.example.com
    certificate:
      enabled: true
      secretName: rest-api-mysite-example-com-tls
      commonName: rest-api.mysite.example.com
```

The chart creates a cert-manager `Certificate` for the ingress TLS Secret when `ingress.certificate.enabled: true`. The certificate is issued by the REST stack's `nico-rest-ca-issuer`, so this is a quick self-signed/private-CA setup suitable for lab and site-local deployments. If your cluster already has a TLS Secret for the domain, set `ingress.certificate.enabled: false` and keep `ingress.tls[].secretName` pointed at that existing Secret.

The ingress routes to the chart-managed `nico-rest-api` Service on `service.port`; the API pod still serves plain HTTP internally and does not need TLS-specific configuration. If your cluster does not already have an ingress controller, run setup with the optional nginx controller:

```bash
./setup.sh --install-ingress-nginx
# or
export NICO_INSTALL_INGRESS_NGINX=true
./setup.sh -y
```

### 3f. Review site-agent Config

The defaults in `helm-prereqs/values/nico-site-agent.yaml` point at the Zalando-managed `nico-pg-cluster` (`DB_ADDR: nico-pg-cluster.postgres.svc.cluster.local`, `DB_DATABASE: nico_rest`), which is the same cluster used by `nico-rest-api`. No changes are needed for a standard deployment.

`DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` are injected at runtime from the `db-creds` Kubernetes Secret (created by the `nico-rest-common` sub-chart during Phase 7g). The Secret is referenced via `secrets.dbCreds` in the site-agent values.

For a non-standard database, override the connection config:

```yaml
secrets:
  dbCreds: my-site-agent-db-secret   # Secret must have DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD keys

envConfig:
  DB_DATABASE: "my-database"
  DB_ADDR: "my-postgres.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local"
```

### 3g. Configure MetalLB

MetalLB provides LoadBalancer IPs for NICo Core services (nico-api, DHCP, DNS, PXE, SSH console). Without it, those services stay in `<pending>` state and the site is unreachable.

> **NTP note:** NICo does not run a standalone NTP service. Instead, NTP server addresses are provided to managed hosts via DHCP option 42--configured in the `nico-dhcp` chart Kea hook parameters (`nico-ntpserver`). Point this to your enterprise NTP servers.

Edit `helm-prereqs/values/metallb-config.yaml`--this file ships pre-populated with example values. Replace all values labeled `# EXAMPLE` with your site-specific configuration before running `setup.sh`.

| Field | Example value in file | What to put for your site |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `IPAddressPool.spec.addresses` (internal) | `10.180.126.160/28` | Your internal VIP CIDR |
| `IPAddressPool.spec.addresses` (external) | `10.180.126.176/28` | Your external VIP CIDR |
| `BGPPeer.spec.myASN` | `4244766850` | Your cluster-side ASN (same for all nodes) |
| `BGPPeer.spec.peerASN` | `4244766851/852/853` | TOR ASN per node (unique per node) |
| `BGPPeer.spec.peerAddress` | `10.180.248.80/82/84` | TOR switch IP reachable from each node |
| `BGPPeer.spec.nodeSelectors` hostnames | `rno1-m04-d04-cpu-{1,2,3}` | Your actual node hostnames (`kubectl get nodes`) |

Add or remove `BGPPeer` blocks to match your node count, with one block per worker node.

<Note>If your environment does not use BGP (local dev, flat network), comment out the `BGPPeer` and `BGPAdvertisement` sections and uncomment the `L2Advertisement` section at the bottom of the file.</Note>

### 3h. Assign Service VIPs

Each NICo Core service that exposes a LoadBalancer needs a **specific, stable IP** from your MetalLB pool. Without explicit assignments, MetalLB picks IPs randomly on each install, which means your DHCP relay, DNS records, PXE config, and API hostname cannot be pre-configured and will break on redeploy.

Open `helm-prereqs/values/nico-core.yaml` and update the VIP for each service:

| Service | Values key | Pool to use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `nico-api` external API | `nico-api.externalService.annotations` | External (client-facing) |
| `nico-dhcp` | `nico-dhcp.externalService.annotations` | Internal (cluster-facing) |
| `nico-dns` instance-0 | `nico-dns.externalService.perPodAnnotations[0]` | Internal or External |
| `nico-dns` instance-1 | `nico-dns.externalService.perPodAnnotations[1]` | Internal or External |
| `nico-pxe` | `nico-pxe.externalService.annotations` | Internal (cluster-facing) |
| `nico-ssh-console-rs` | `nico-ssh-console-rs.externalService.annotations` | Internal (cluster-facing) |

All IPs must be within the `IPAddressPool` ranges you defined in `values/metallb-config.yaml` and must be unique across services.

- **nico-dhcp Note**: `externalService.enabled: true` must be set explicitly; it defaults to false in the chart.
- **nico-dns Note**: Use `perPodAnnotations` (a list) rather than `annotations` because each replica gets its own VIP.
- **nico-api IP and DNS Note**: The nico-api VIP must resolve in external DNS to the `hostname` you set in Step 3c.

### 3i. (Optional) Pre-set the Site UUID

On a fresh install, you normally leave `NICO_SITE_UUID` unset. `setup.sh` resolves the UUID in several ways: it tries to reuse the UUID from a prior install (site-agent ConfigMap); if that fails, it adopts an existing REST site with the same name, or mints a UUID and seeds the site record itself (see Step 5). You only need to set the UUID explicitly to bind the site-agent to a site that already exists:

```bash
export NICO_SITE_UUID=<your-uuid>   # must be a valid UUID v4 of an existing REST site
```

The resolved UUID is used as the Temporal namespace for the site and as the `CLUSTER_ID` passed to the site-agent. On reruns the identity stays stable; if you change `NICO_SITE_UUID` to rebind, `setup.sh` detects the stale registration and the bootstrap re-registers automatically.

### 3j. Validate Configuration

Run the pre-flight check to catch issues before deployment:

```bash
cd helm-prereqs/
source ./preflight.sh
```

The `preflight.sh` script is also run automatically at the start of every `setup.sh` invocation.

The `preflight.sh` script checks the following:

| Category | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| Environment variables | Required vars are set; no `https://` prefix on registry; version tags start with `v`; UUID is valid if set; KUBECONFIG path exists if set |
| Required tools | `helm`, `helmfile`, `kubectl`, `jq`, `ssh-keygen` are in PATH |
| `values/metallb-config.yaml` | File exists; YAML is valid; at least one IPAddressPool defined; exactly one advertisement mode active (BGP or L2, not both); example placeholder hostnames not still present |
| Cluster reachability | `kubectl` can reach the API server. |
| Node resources | At least three schedulable nodes |
| Per-node: kernel parameters | `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1` and `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` on every node |
| Per-node: DNS | `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local` resolves on every node. |
| Registry connectivity | The registry host responds to an HTTPS probe. |
| NICo REST source tree | Verifies `rest-api/` is present in the checkout (REST is in-tree; no separate clone) |

For air-gapped clusters, the per-node checks pull `busybox:1.36` by default. If your cluster cannot reach Docker Hub, set `PREFLIGHT_CHECK_IMAGE` to a local mirror:

```bash
export PREFLIGHT_CHECK_IMAGE=my-registry.example.com/busybox:1.36
```

## Step 4 — Run the Setup Script

Run the `setup.sh` script as follows:

```bash
cd helm-prereqs/
./setup.sh        # interactive — prompts before deploying NICo Core and NICo REST
./setup.sh -y     # non-interactive — deploys everything
```

The `setup.sh` script installs all prerequisites and NICo components in sequential phases:

<Anchor id="setup-script-phases"/>

| Phase | What it installs |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0 | DNS check (NodeLocal DNSCache or CoreDNS) |
| 1 | local-path-provisioner + StorageClasses |
| 1b | postgres-operator (Zalando) |
| 1c | MetalLB + site BGP/L2 config |
| 1d | Optional ingress-nginx controller (`--install-ingress-nginx`) |
| 2 | cert-manager + Vault TLS bootstrap (PKI chain) |
| 3 | HashiCorp Vault (3-node HA Raft) |
| 4 | Vault init + unseal + SSH host key |
| 5 | external-secrets + nico-prereqs + nico-pg-cluster |
| 6 | **NICo Core** (nico helm release) |
| 7a-7h | **NICo REST** full stack (postgres, Keycloak, Temporal, nico-rest, site-agent) |

The following components are deployed:

```
local-path-provisioner     (raw manifest - StorageClasses for Vault + PostgreSQL PVCs)
metallb                    (metallb/metallb 0.14.5 - LoadBalancer IPs via BGP or L2)
ingress-nginx              (optional - Ingress controller for REST API FQDN/TLS)
postgres-operator          (zalando/postgres-operator 1.10.1 - manages nico-pg-cluster)
cert-manager               (jetstack/cert-manager v1.17.1)
vault                      (hashicorp/vault 0.25.0, 3-node HA Raft, TLS)
external-secrets           (external-secrets/external-secrets 0.14.3)
nico-prereqs            (this Helm chart - nico-system namespace)
NICo Core                  (../helm - nico-core.yaml values)
NICo REST                  (rest-api/helm/charts/nico-rest)
  ├── nico-rest-ca-issuer ClusterIssuer (cert-manager.io)
  ├── postgres StatefulSet  (temporal + keycloak databases)
  ├── keycloak              (dev OIDC IdP, nico-dev realm)
  ├── temporal              (temporal-helm/temporal, mTLS)
  ├── nico-rest          (API, cert-manager, workflow, site-manager)
  └── nico-rest-site-agent (StatefulSet, bootstrap via site-manager)
```

For manual phase-by-phase installation, re-running individual phases, or debugging failures, refer to the [Reference Installation](../installation-options/reference-install.md) guide.

## Step 5 — Verify the Site Controller

Before ingesting hosts, verify that all site controller components are healthy.

### Check That All Pods Are Running

```bash
kubectl get pods -n nico-system        # NICo Core
kubectl get pods -n nico-rest          # NICo REST
kubectl get pods -n temporal            # Temporal
```

### Verify That the Site-agent Is Connected

```bash
kubectl logs -n nico-rest -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nico-rest-site-agent --prefix \
    | grep "NicoClient"
```

Look for the "successfully connected to server" message in the logs.

### Verify That the LoadBalancer IPs Are Assigned

```bash
kubectl get svc -n nico-system | grep LoadBalancer
```

All LoadBalancer services should have an external IP from your `IPAddressPool` ranges. If any show `<pending>`, MetalLB has not assigned an IP. Check BGP session status on your TOR switches and verify `values/metallb-config.yaml` has correct peer addresses.

### Verify That DHCP and PXE Are Serving

```bash
kubectl get svc nico-dhcp nico-pxe -n nico-system
```

Both external IPs should be within your internal VIP pool range.

### Acquire a Keycloak Access Token

This section only applies if `keycloak.enabled: true` in `values/nico-rest.yaml` (the default). If you disabled the bundled Keycloak and pointed `nico-rest-api` at your own IdP, obtain tokens from that IdP instead.

The `setup.sh` script deploys a dev Keycloak instance with a `nico` realm pre-loaded with the `ncx-service` client (M2M / `client_credentials`).

| Value | Setting |
|-------|---------|
| Token endpoint | `http://keycloak.nico-rest:8082/realms/nico/protocol/openid-connect/token` |
| `grant_type` | `client_credentials` |
| `client_id` | `ncx-service` |
| `client_secret` | `nico-local-secret` |

<Warning>Fetch tokens from inside the cluster only. *Do not* port-forward Keycloak and request tokens against `localhost`. The resulting JWT `iss` claim will not match what `nico-rest-api` expects, and the token will be rejected.</Warning>

Use the helper script, which runs `curl` from a throw-away in-cluster pod:

```bash
TOKEN=$(helm-prereqs/keycloak/get-token.sh)
```

Verify the token against `nico-rest-api`:

```bash
kubectl run -i --rm --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl curl-test \
  -n nico-rest --quiet -- \
  -sf http://nico-rest-api.nico-rest:8388/v2/org/ncx/nico/user/current \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Set up nicocli and Verify your Site

NICo has two CLIs that serve different purposes:

| CLI | Communicates with | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `nicocli` | NICo REST (REST API) | Site management, org bootstrap, instance operations |
| `nico-admin-cli` | NICo Core (gRPC API) | Host ingestion, credentials, expected machines, TPM approval |

`nicocli` is built from the `rest-api/` directory. `nico-admin-cli` is built from `crates/admin-cli`.

#### 1. Build and Install the CLI

```bash
cd rest-api
make nico-cli           # installs to $(go env GOPATH)/bin/nicocli
```

#### 2. Generate the Default Config File

```bash
nicocli init             # writes ~/.nico/config.yaml
```

#### 3. Port-forward `nico-rest-api` to localhost

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n nico-rest svc/nico-rest-api 8388:8388
```

#### 4. Edit `~/.nico/config.yaml`

```yaml
api:
  base: http://localhost:8388
  org: ncx
  name: nico
auth:
  token: <paste value of $TOKEN here>
```

#### 5. Bootstrap the Org (Required One-Time Call)

This `GET` endpoint lazily initializes the org on first call as follows:
1. Checks if service account is enabled in the auth config
2. Creates an **InfrastructureProvider** for the org if one doesn't exist
3. Creates a **Tenant** with targeted instance creation enabled if one doesn't exist
4. Creates a **TenantAccount** linking the provider and tenant if one doesn't exist
5. Returns the service account status with the provider and tenant IDs

Without this call, site operations return 404. Subsequent calls are read-only.

```bash
TOKEN=$(helm-prereqs/keycloak/get-token.sh)

curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    http://localhost:8388/v2/org/ncx/nico/service-account/current \
    | python3 -m json.tool
```

#### 6. Verify your Site

**Do not run `nicocli site create`.** `setup.sh` Phase 7g already bootstraps and registers the site automatically via the `nico-rest-site-agent` bootstrap Job (`POST /v1/site` to `nico-rest-site-manager`), obtains a one-time password (OTP), and stores the registration in the `site-registration` Secret. Running `nicocli site create` would create a second site that the already-deployed site-agent cannot use — the site-agent is bound to the UUID generated during setup and cannot be reassigned without a full redeploy.

This is a **one-to-one deployment**: one site per NICo installation. The site is managed by `setup.sh`; do not create additional sites manually.

To verify the site was registered correctly:

```bash
nicocli site list
```

You should see exactly one site matching the UUID in `NICO_SITE_UUID` (or the UUID auto-generated by `setup.sh` if `NICO_SITE_UUID` was not set). You can also confirm the site-agent registered successfully:

```bash
kubectl logs -n nico-rest -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nico-rest-site-agent --prefix \
    | grep -i "registered\|bootstrap\|site"
```

### Overall Health Check

Run the following commands to verify that all components are healthy:

```bash
kubectl get clusterissuer
kubectl get clustersecretstore
kubectl get pods -n metallb-system
kubectl get ipaddresspool,bgppeer -n metallb-system
kubectl get pods -n postgres
kubectl get pods -n nico-system
kubectl get jobs -n nico-system
kubectl get secret nico-roots -n nico-system

For troubleshooting common issues, refer to the [Reference Installation — Troubleshooting](../installation-options/reference-install.md#troubleshooting) guide.

## Step 6 — Connect the OOB Network

Configure the out-of-band network to relay BMC DHCP requests to the NICo DHCP service.

1. *Configure the DHCP relay* on your OOB switches to forward DHCP requests to the `nico-dhcp` LoadBalancer VIP (assigned in Step 3h).

2. *Verify DHCP requests are reaching NICo* by checking the DHCP service logs:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n nico-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nico-dhcp --tail=20
   ```

For detailed OOB network requirements, refer to the [BMC and Out-of-Band Setup](../prerequisites/bmc-oob-setup.md) guide.

## Step 7 — Discover Your First Host

This step uses `nico-admin-cli`, the gRPC CLI for NICo Core. Build it from the `infra-controller` repo:

```bash
cd infra-controller/
cargo build --release -p nico-admin-cli
# Binary: target/release/nico-admin-cli
```

Alternatively, use the containerized version bundled in the `nico-api` pod (available at `/opt/nico/nico-admin-cli` inside the container).

The `<api-url>` in the commands below is the NICo Core gRPC API endpoint. This is the `nico-api` hostname configured in [Step 3c](#3c-configure-nico-core-site-deployment), not the REST API used in Step 5. The format is typically `https://api-<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>.<SITE_DOMAIN_NAME>`. You can also retrieve it from the LoadBalancer VIP:

```bash
kubectl get svc nico-api -n nico-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

### Set Site-wide Credentials

Configure the credentials NICo will apply to BMCs and UEFI after ingestion:

```bash
nico-admin-cli -a <api-url> credential add-bmc --kind=site-wide-root --password='<password>'
nico-admin-cli -a <api-url> host generate-host-uefi-password
nico-admin-cli -a <api-url> credential add-uefi --kind=host --password='<password>'
```

### Upload the Expected Machines Manifest

Prepare an `expected_machines.json` with the BMC MAC address, factory default credentials, and chassis serial number for each host:

```json
{
  "expected_machines": [
    {
      "bmc_mac_address": "C4:5A:B1:C8:38:0D",
      "bmc_username": "root",
      "bmc_password": "default-password",
      "chassis_serial_number": "SERIAL-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Upload the manifest:

```bash
nico-admin-cli -a <api-url> em replace-all --filename expected_machines.json
```

### Approve the host for ingestion

NICo uses Measured Boot with TPM v2.0 to enforce cryptographic identity:

```bash
nico-admin-cli -a <api-url> att mb site trusted-machine approve \* persist --pcr-registers="0,3,5,6"
```

NICo will now discover the host via Redfish, pair it with its DPU(s), provision the DPU, and bring the host to a ready state. For more details, refer to the [Ingesting Hosts](../provisioning/ingesting-hosts.md) guide.

### Monitor Host Discovery

```bash
kubectl logs -n nico-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nico-api --tail=50 \
    | grep -i "site explorer\|bmc\|discovery"
```

## Teardown

To perform teardown, run the following command:

```bash
cd helm-prereqs/
./clean.sh
```

This removes NICo REST, NICo Core, all helmfile releases, cluster-scoped resources, namespaces, and released PersistentVolumes. For details on what `clean.sh` does and the removal order, refer to the [Reference Installation](installation-options/reference-install.md) guide.
